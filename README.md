# Interior-Design
A frontend-only prototype for an Interior Design Client Dashboard. Features include project tracking, animated progress bars, dark mode, AOS scroll animations, and image modal viewer. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for design showcase purposes
Absolutely! Here's the updated **GitHub README paragraph** that clearly mentions it's a **prototype** and not a fully functional production system:

### 🏠 Interior Designer Architect Platform

The **Interior Designer Architect Platform** is a sleek, responsive **prototype** designed to visualize how interior design projects can be managed online. This front-end demo simulates a client dashboard where users can explore project progress, materials used, and associated costs in a clean, modern interface.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is a **UI/UX prototype only**. Login functionality, data persistence, and server-side logic are simulated and **not connected to a real backend**. It serves as a concept for future development or integration with real systems.
